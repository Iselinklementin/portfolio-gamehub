This is my first project when I started my studies on Noroff.

Gamehub is a cross-course project and had different criterea to submission.

# Course Assignment
**HTML - CSS**

### Goal
To put into practice everything you’ve learned about HTML and CSS over this course.

## Brief
You need to deliver a properly functioning, responsive website for the assignment brief that you chose in Design 1.
The site needs to have every page listed in the site architecture on your chosen brief. 
Certain functionality that requires JavaScript can be mimicked for now, for example a log in page could link across from the ‘Sign in’ button.

- The HTML should be semantic and neat.
- The CSS should follow the DRY principle and be easy to read.
- The website should be responsive and look good at every screen size with no horizontal scrollbars. Use Flexbox and CSS Grids where appropriate.
- Do not use a CSS framework like Bootstrap, we want to see that you can build responsive sites without the help of a framework.
- The site should be WCAG compliant and accessibility taken into account.
- Each page should have a unique meta description, title, and h1.
- You may use external sources to show you how to achieve specific effects, and these should be included in your report.

# Course Assignment
**Interaction Design**

## Brief
In this assignment you will work on your cross-course project to:

- Ensure that the website is user-centric.
- Ensure that the website is focused on helping users achieve their goals clearly and simply.

## Process

- Look over the data collected from Hotjar and determine whether there are any aspects of the site that could cause problems for users. Consider conducting further contextual inquiry interviews. This will allow you to see users interacting with the site in-person.
- Perform accessibility testing on your website to ensure it’s easy to use for users with accessibility issues.
- Decide on which areas of the site to focus and then improve the interactions for users.
- Use your skills in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to improve the website.
- Once you’ve added your changes, test the site with at least one more user (preferably 3-5). Gain feedback from the user and determine whether the changes you’ve made have improved the issues on the website.
- Write a report detailing the research you conducted during this course, and include the changes you made to your website.
